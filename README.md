How to Run the Application 

While AngularJS applications are purely client-side code, it is possible to open them in a web browser directly from the file system .This application is best served using an HTTP web server, for security considerations. 


Most modern browsers will not allow JavaScript to make server requests if the page is loaded directly from the file system.

->	 Localhost/f1/index.html
